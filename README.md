# Monk-AI---Data-quality-assessment
# Assessing frame quality for a vehicle damage detection algorithm: Project Overview 
* Creating a tool to assess video frame quality for a specefic machine learning algorithm.
* Runing fast deep learning models on videos to extract a confidence metric for selected vehicle parts.
* Reducing Data flow at the input of the segmentation algorithm. 
* Deploying the model.
