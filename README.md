# Monk-AI---Data-quality-assessment
# Assessing Image quality for a vehicle damage detection algorithm: Project Overview 
* Creating a tool to assess image data quality for a specefic machine learning algorithm.
* Implementing a faster algorithm using machine learning techniques to eliminate non pertinent data before passing it to the vehicle damage detection model.
* Reducing Data flow and helping to optimize a machine learning model. 
* Integrating the model into the company's phone application.

## Data ( Webscraping | company provided data)

### Webscraping data : initial model

Tweaked a web scraper to collect 500 car images, scraping a 100 images for each keyword. I then removed some images manually and used 100 images for training and 10 images to test the yolo model at first.
